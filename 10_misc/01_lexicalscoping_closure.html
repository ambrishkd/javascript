    // Lexical scoping: Inner functions have access to outer function variables.

    function outer() {
        let username = "sam"
        let password = "sam@123"
        function inner() {

    // Closure:

    function mainFunc() {
        let browser = "chrome"
        function logBrowser() {
            console.log(browser)
        }
        return logBrowser
    }
    let val = mainFunc()
    val()

    /*
    NOTE:
    - As in line 38, mainFunc is calling and after that its executional context should be deleted.
    - But here, mainFunc is returning logBrowser and that doesn't mean only that scope will be returned.
    - It will return outer mainFunc lexical scoping with it.
    - That's why we can access browser variable even after calling val() function in line 39.
    - And that's called closure.

    // Real-world scenario problem where closure is used:
    
    // Problem: On clicking each button, background color of body should change.

    // Solution 1:
    // We will target each button with their id and change color accordingly.

    // Solution 2:
    // We will make a click handler and change color accordingly.
    // So basically, closure will be used here in this solution or method.

    function clickHandler(color) {
        // document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${color}` // we will not change color directly, instead return a func
        function changeBG() {
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${color}`
        }
        return changeBG
    }
    document.getElementById("orange").onclick = clickHandler("orange")
    document.getElementById("green").onclick = clickHandler("green")

    /*
    Problem in line 62:
    - As onclick demands a function, but here if we pass this () then method will executed instantly
    - It will not wait for click event.
    - So that's why we need to return a function from clickHandler function
    - And that inner function of clickHandler will handle the bg color changing
    - And that inner function has access to color we pass in clickHandler
    - Hence that's one of the real-world scenario where closure is being used.
