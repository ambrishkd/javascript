Q: Do Js really have classes?
A: Yes, Js does have classes. This was introduced in ES6. However, it is important to note that Js is
    primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing
    prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. 
    In other words, it provides a more familiar syntac for developers coming from class-based languages
    such as C++ or Java, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.
    
- Object: 
    Collection of properties and methods

Q: Why use OOP?
A: To avoid spaghetti code and to avoid messed up code

- Parts of OOP:
    Object literal
    Constructor function
    Prototypes
    Classes
    Instances(new, this)

- 4 pillars:
    Inheritance
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation
    Polymorphism
